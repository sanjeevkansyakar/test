# Software Intern Test

Welcome to the Software Intern Test! This project assesses your skills in creating a multi-level form with a percentage indication of form completion. Additionally, the form should support the uploading of documents, and the data will be stored in a database. The preferred stack for this test is PERN (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) or your preferred tech stack.

## Task Description

Your task is to build a multi-level form with the following features:

1. **Multi-Level Form:** Create a form with at least two levels. For example, the first level might collect basic information (e.g., name, email), and the second level could gather more detailed information (e.g., address, phone number).

2. **Percentage Indication:** Implement a dynamic percentage indicator that reflects the completion status of the form. The percentage should be updated accordingly as the user progresses through the form.

3. **Document Upload:** Allow users to upload documents (e.g., PDFs, images) as part of the form. Ensure that the uploaded documents are associated with the user's form data.

4. **Database Integration (PERN Stack) or your preferred tech stack:** Utilize the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to store and retrieve form data, including the uploaded documents.

## Submission
